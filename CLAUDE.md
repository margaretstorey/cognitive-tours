# Cognitive Tours — Project State for AI Agents

> Read this before touching any code or making any suggestions.
> This is the cognitive layer — the bridge between intent (Spec Kit) and code.

## What this project is

**Cognitive Tours** is a software comprehension tool where developers create
waypoints and guided tours to navigate intent, decisions, and code together.
The core thesis: understanding cannot be outsourced or automated. Tours you
create yourself repair your own cognitive debt. AI is a scaffold, not a substitute.

**Domains:** cognitive.tours | cognitivetours.dev
**GitHub:** margaretstorey/cognitive-tours
**Research foundation:** Triple Debt Model paper (arXiv:2603.22106)

## Current technical state (June 2026)

### What is built and working
- Next.js 16 + TypeScript + Tailwind + React Flow (@xyflow/react 12)
- SQLite + Prisma persistence — data survives page refresh
- Three-panel layout: graph (left), waypoint detail (right), tour bar (top)
- 8 waypoint types with colour coding
- Tours with Next/Prev navigation and tour focus mode (non-tour nodes dim — approach under reconsideration, see Key Decisions)
- Edge dimming fixed — both endpoints must be outside the active tour for an edge/label to dim ✅
- Edge labels showing relationships between waypoints
- filePath field on waypoints with clipboard copy and VS Code link
- Create, edit, delete waypoints and tours
- Drag to connect waypoints with optional edge label prompt
- 30+ seeded waypoints and 4 tours (self-documenting — the app documents itself)
- Spec Kit installed with constitution at .specify/memory/constitution.md
- Filter/hide waypoints by type - toggle panel with active badge ✅
- Deployed to Vercel with Turso persistent SQLite (survives deploys, shared across users) ✅
- Root component renamed CognitiveToursApp, repo renamed to cognitive-tours ✅
- Page title fixed (was showing default "Create Next App") ✅
- Git repository reconnected in Vercel project settings — see Known Issues ✅
- README written and reflects current project state ✅
- Constitution updated to Cognitive Tours (v1.3.0) ✅  
- ADR 003 (Use Turso) written at docs/adr/003-use-turso.md ✅
- tours/ folder established for markdown tour exports ✅
- Docent mode — per-step narrative on tour stops, displayed in amber bar below tour bar ✅
- Markdown view for tours (toggle from tour bar) + dated snapshot export to tours/ folder (well manually) ✅
- Optional waypoint description — missing description currently shows an error; should fail gracefully (show nothing) ✅
- Suppress amber narrative bar in markdown mode — narrative already appears as blockquote in markdown view; amber bar is redundant when markdownViewOpen is true ✅
- VS Code links in markdown view — filePath should render as a clickable vscode://file/... link in TourMarkdownView, matching the behaviour in the detail panel ✅
- Search/filter bar on graph — graph is getting dense; need a way to find nodes quickly by name so added this, also has a filter by type! ✅
- Alphabetical ordering in tour waypoint picker — make it easier to find waypoints when adding stops to a tour ✅
- Tour markdown view and export — toggle from tour bar; export downloads a dated .md snapshot. ✅
- Playwright test for docent mode amber bar ✅
- End-to-end docent feature tour ("Building Docent Mode — From Need to Test") ✅

---

### What is NOT yet built
- File content preview in detail panel
- AI-guided waypoint creation
- Export to JSON or Markdown
- Playwright automated tests
- Edge deletion via UI (keyboard delete unreliable on Mac)
- Edge detail/edit panel
- Separate Tours tab with independent layout

## Maintenance reminders
- **Backup before onboarding new collaborators** — visit /api/data and 
  save the JSON before giving anyone else access to the live app. Last backup June 29, 2026.
- **Update "Last updated" date** at the top of this file each session.
- **Create a waypoint** for any significant new feature or decision before closing a session.

### Known issues
- Edge deletion via keyboard doesn't work reliably on Mac
- Some tour connections point at wrong nodes (e.g. FileType → CognitiveTourApp should point to the Waypoints feature node instead) — needs a pass to verify across all tours
- **Vercel Git connection can silently disconnect.** If pushes stop triggering deploys (commits show on `origin/main` via `git log`, but nothing new appears in Vercel's Deployments tab), check Project Settings → Git in Vercel. It may show "Connect Git" instead of a connected repo. Fix: reconnect via "Adjust GitHub App Permissions" if the repo isn't listed, then "Connect."
- **No undo and no multi-user conflict protection** — the app has no undo 
  and no locking. With multiple users, concurrent edits can overwrite each 
  other silently. Back up /api/data before collaborative sessions.

### Small improvements (quality of life)

- **Simplify tour bar in markdown mode** — Prev/Next buttons and step counter are redundant when the full tour is visible as a document. Hide them when markdownViewOpen is true, keep only the tour selector, markdown toggle, and export button. Still pending - not sure how I want to address this - not broken just a bit confusing for now.

## The ontology (waypoint types and their meaning) - note not evaluated

Margaret-Anne's intended ontology — not fully implemented yet:

**Strategic level:**
- **Goal** — the highest level "why" (e.g. "Mitigate and repair cognitive debt") — now implemented as a type ✅
- **User Need** — specific needs that support goals

**Tactical level:**
- **Feature** — capabilities of the tool, can decompose into sub-features
- **Code Component** — implementation artifacts, intended to be hierarchical (high → low level) but currently flat
- **ADR** — architectural decision records, linked to code components
- **Test** — linked to features they validate
- **Risk** — linked to features or ADRs
- **Open Question** — unresolved issues
- **Todo** — work to be done (not yet implemented as a type)

**Intended edge semantics but not enforced:**
- Goal → motivates → User Need
- User Need → supported by → Feature
- Feature → contains → Feature
- Feature → implemented by → Code Component
- Code Component → decomposes into → Code Component
- ADR → leads to → Code Component
- Test → validates → Feature
- Risk → threatens → Feature or ADR

**Not done**
- **SDR as waypoint type** — Social Decision Records (team/social decisions, 
  analogous to ADRs) may warrant their own type. See Open Question waypoint 
  added June 29. Reference: Team Topologies post by Vanessa Formicola.

**Note from tour review (June 16):** not every true relationship needs a graph edge. Some relationships are better expressed in a waypoint's own description/notes than as a separate edge — especially when an edge would point backward through an otherwise linear tour sequence and create a confusing visual knot. Edges are for the map; not every map fact needs to become a tour beat.

---

## Key decisions made (not in Spec Kit)

- **Not a code analysis tool** — manual curation is intentional. The act of
  creating waypoints and tours IS the cognitive debt repair.
- **Tours you create yourself** are more valuable than prepackaged ones.
  Someone else's tours give the appearance of understanding, not the real thing.
- **AI as scaffold, not substitute** — AI helps you capture your understanding,
  it doesn't generate understanding for you.
- **Not a knowledge graph** — knowledge graphs are about information retrieval.
  Cognitive Tours is about understanding construction. The graph is a scaffold,
  not a deliverable.
- **Web app, not VS Code extension** — tool-agnostic, shareable URL. VS Code
  link is provided as a convenience but the tool doesn't require VS Code.
- **Single user for now** — no auth, no multi-project, no collaboration yet.
- **Turso for cloud, SQLite locally** — Vercel deployment live; Turso provides persistent SQLite across deploys.
- **Tours will move to their own tab** — the main graph is a map for exploration; tours are guided paths. These are different purposes and warrant separate views. Dimming non-tour nodes on the main graph is no longer the desired approach. Tours tab should use Dagre auto-layout (left-to-right or top-to-bottom) rather than manual positioning.
- **Waypoint content must be context-free.** A waypoint's description/notes should make sense regardless of which tour (or no tour) brought a reader to it. Tour-specific transition narrative ("now that you've seen X, let's look at Y") does not belong in waypoint notes — it contaminates the waypoint for every other entry point. For now, if a transition insight is worth keeping, prefer rephrasing it as a standalone true fact about the waypoint itself, or hold it in the tour's own description field as a stopgap. 
- **Tours as markdown.** Using live-render for a tour's markdown versus archived snapshot and the markodwn view is toggled from the tour bar.

## Constitution (8 principles — v1.3.0)

I. Simplicity Over Complexity — YAGNI enforced
II. Incremental Growth — one small verifiable step at a time
III. Intent Before Implementation — spec before code
IV. Clean Readable TypeScript — strict mode, no any
V. Minimal Clear UI — every element earns its place
VI. Waypoints and Tours are Universal — not just for code
VII. Flexible Navigation — code, intent, or both
VIII. Human and Agent Readable — every waypoint meaningful to humans AND agents

Full constitution: .specify/memory/constitution.md

  ## What to work on next (in priority order)

**Session 10 plan**

 1. **AI suggest feature** — "Suggest" button on waypoint description and tour stop narrative fields. Calls Anthropic API server-side to draft suggestions based on waypoint context (label, type, connected nodes, tour sequence). New dependency: @anthropic-ai/sdk. Needs Spec Kit spec (008-ai-suggest) before implementation.
  
2. **Edge management panel** — show edge details in right panel, delete 
   button there.

3. **Tour metadata** — add author (optional text field, manually filled) and updatedAt (auto-timestamp via Prisma @updatedAt) to the Tour model. Display in markdown view and export header. Also fix tour.description not appearing in markdown view/export — should render as preamble paragraph before the first stop.

## What Margaret-Anne is confused about

- How to keep waypoints and tours in sync as the code evolves
- How the cognitive layer (this document + the app's waypoints) connects to
  the intent layer (Spec Kit) and technical layer (code) in a sustainable way
