## What this project is

**Cognitive Tours** is a software comprehension tool where developers create
waypoints and guided tours to navigate intent, decisions, and code together.
The core thesis: understanding cannot be outsourced or automated. Tours you
create yourself repair your own cognitive debt. AI is a scaffold, not a substitute.

**Domains:** cognitive.tours | cognitivetours.dev
**GitHub:** margaretstorey/cognitive-tours
**Research foundation:** Triple Debt Model paper (arXiv:2603.22106)

## Current technical state (June 2026)

### What is built and working
- Next.js 16 + TypeScript + Tailwind + React Flow (@xyflow/react 12)
- SQLite + Prisma persistence — data survives page refresh
- Three-panel layout: graph (left), waypoint detail (right), tour bar (top)
- 8 waypoint types with colour coding
- Tours with Next/Prev navigation and tour focus mode (non-tour nodes dim — approach under reconsideration, see Key Decisions)
- Edge dimming fixed — both endpoints must be outside the active tour for an edge/label to dim ✅
- Edge labels showing relationships between waypoints
- filePath field on waypoints with clipboard copy and VS Code link
- Create, edit, delete waypoints and tours
- Drag to connect waypoints with optional edge label prompt
- 30+ seeded waypoints and 4 tours (self-documenting — the app documents itself)
- Spec Kit installed with constitution at .specify/memory/constitution.md
- Filter/hide waypoints by type - toggle panel with active badge ✅
- Deployed to Vercel with Turso persistent SQLite (survives deploys, shared across users) ✅
- Root component renamed CognitiveToursApp, repo renamed to cognitive-tours ✅
- Page title fixed (was showing default "Create Next App") ✅
- Git repository reconnected in Vercel project settings — see Known Issues ✅
- README written and reflects current project state ✅
- Constitution updated to Cognitive Tours (v1.3.0) ✅  
- ADR 003 (Use Turso) written at docs/adr/003-use-turso.md ✅
- tours/ folder established for markdown tour exports ✅

---

### What is NOT yet built
- File content preview in detail panel
- AI-guided waypoint creation
- Export to JSON or Markdown
- Playwright automated tests
- Edge deletion via UI (keyboard delete unreliable on Mac)
- Edge detail/edit panel
- Separate Tours tab with independent layout
- Per-step tour narrative ("docent mode") — see Open Question below

## Maintenance reminders
- **Backup Turso data periodically** — visit https://cognitive-tours.vercel.app/api/data and save the JSON. Last backup: June 2, 2026.
- **Update "Last updated" date** at the top of this file each session.
- **Create a waypoint** for any significant new feature or decision before closing a session.

### Known issues
- Edge deletion via keyboard doesn't work reliably on Mac
- Some tour connections point at wrong nodes (e.g. FileType → CognitiveTourApp should point to the Waypoints feature node instead) — needs a pass to verify across all tours
- **Vercel Git connection can silently disconnect.** If pushes stop triggering deploys (commits show on `origin/main` via `git log`, but nothing new appears in Vercel's Deployments tab), check Project Settings → Git in Vercel. It may show "Connect Git" instead of a connected repo. Fix: reconnect via "Adjust GitHub App Permissions" if the repo isn't listed, then "Connect."
- **ADR 002 (Local React State, No Persistence for MVP) is orphaned** — the file exists at docs/adr/002-*.md but has no waypoint pointing to it, and still references "Shrimp 2.0" / "ShrimpApp" throughout. It's correctly marked Superseded (replaced by Phase 2 Prisma/SQLite) but isn't part of the graph. See "What to work on next."
- **ADR convention is inconsistent.** Some ADR waypoints (e.g. "Use React Flow") have a filePath pointing to a real docs/adr/*.md file. Others (e.g."Others (e.g. "Deploy to Vercel") have filePath pointing to implementation code — Use Turso now has docs/adr/003-use-turso.md ✅"

## The ontology (waypoint types and their meaning) - note not evaluated

Margaret-Anne's intended ontology — not fully implemented yet:

**Strategic level:**
- **Goal** — the highest level "why" (e.g. "Mitigate and repair cognitive debt") — now implemented as a type ✅
- **User Need** — specific needs that support goals

**Tactical level:**
- **Feature** — capabilities of the tool, can decompose into sub-features
- **Code Component** — implementation artifacts, intended to be hierarchical (high → low level) but currently flat
- **ADR** — architectural decision records, linked to code components
- **Test** — linked to features they validate
- **Risk** — linked to features or ADRs
- **Open Question** — unresolved issues
- **Todo** — work to be done (not yet implemented as a type)

**Intended edge semantics:**
- Goal → motivates → User Need
- User Need → supported by → Feature
- Feature → contains → Feature
- Feature → implemented by → Code Component
- Code Component → decomposes into → Code Component
- ADR → leads to → Code Component
- Test → validates → Feature
- Risk → threatens → Feature or ADR

**Note from tour review (June 16):** not every true relationship needs a graph edge. Some relationships are better expressed in a waypoint's own description/notes than as a separate edge — especially when an edge would point backward through an otherwise linear tour sequence and create a confusing visual knot. Edges are for the map; not every map fact needs to become a tour beat.

## Key decisions made (not in Spec Kit)

- **Not a code analysis tool** — manual curation is intentional. The act of
  creating waypoints and tours IS the cognitive debt repair.
- **Tours you create yourself** are more valuable than prepackaged ones.
  Someone else's tours give the appearance of understanding, not the real thing.
- **AI as scaffold, not substitute** — AI helps you capture your understanding,
  it doesn't generate understanding for you.
- **Not a knowledge graph** — knowledge graphs are about information retrieval.
  Cognitive Tours is about understanding construction. The graph is a scaffold,
  not a deliverable.
- **Web app, not VS Code extension** — tool-agnostic, shareable URL. VS Code
  link is provided as a convenience but the tool doesn't require VS Code.
- **Single user for now** — no auth, no multi-project, no collaboration yet.
- **Turso for cloud, SQLite locally** — Vercel deployment live; Turso provides persistent SQLite across deploys.
- **Tours will move to their own tab** — the main graph is a map for exploration; tours are guided paths. These are different purposes and warrant separate views. Dimming non-tour nodes on the main graph is no longer the desired approach. Tours tab should use Dagre auto-layout (left-to-right or top-to-bottom) rather than manual positioning.
- **Waypoint content must be context-free.** A waypoint's description/notes should make sense regardless of which tour (or no tour) brought a reader to it. Tour-specific transition narrative ("now that you've seen X, let's look at Y") does not belong in waypoint notes — it contaminates the waypoint for every other entry point. For now, if a transition insight is worth keeping, prefer rephrasing it as a standalone true fact about the waypoint itself, or hold it in the tour's own description field as a stopgap. See "docent mode" Open Question below for the real fix.

## Constitution (8 principles — v1.3.0)

I. Simplicity Over Complexity — YAGNI enforced
II. Incremental Growth — one small verifiable step at a time
III. Intent Before Implementation — spec before code
IV. Clean Readable TypeScript — strict mode, no any
V. Minimal Clear UI — every element earns its place
VI. Waypoints and Tours are Universal — not just for code
VII. Flexible Navigation — code, intent, or both
VIII. Human and Agent Readable — every waypoint meaningful to humans AND agents

Full constitution: .specify/memory/constitution.md

  ## What to work on next (in priority order)

1. **Clean up stale waypoints in the app** — rename any remaining Shrimp 
   references (w11 filePath still points to ShrimpApp.tsx, w12 still called 
   "ShrimpApp", tour t01 still named "How Shrimp Works"), fix incorrect tour 
   connections flagged in Known Issues. Do this directly in the running app.

2. **Delete "Start here - overview" tour** (t-1780379652948) — redundant, 
   decided June 16. Do this directly in the running app.

3. **Decide the ADR convention** — every ADR gets a backing docs/adr/*.md 
   file with filePath pointing to it. ADR 003 (Turso) is now done. ADR 002 
   still has Shrimp references and needs updating. Deploy to Vercel ADR 
   needs a backing file.

4. **Create waypoint for ADR 002** — link filePath to docs/adr/002-*.md, 
   update Shrimp references in that file.

5. **Begin Tours tab design** — separate tab with Dagre auto-layout, 
   independent of main graph.

6. **Docent mode (real fix)** — add a `narrative` text field to the 
   `TourWaypoint` join table for per-step transition text. Schema migration 
   + API + TourBar UI. Use `/speckit-specify` to start spec 006.

7. **Edge management panel** — show edge details in right panel, delete 
   button there.

8. **Playwright tests** — before sharing with real users.

9. Markdown tour export — tours can be manually saved to `tours/` as dated 
  markdown snapshots (see `tours/re-entry-tour-june2.md` for the format). 
  Automated export from the app is a future feature.

## What Margaret-Anne is confused about

- How to keep waypoints and tours in sync as the code evolves
- How the cognitive layer (this document + the app's waypoints) connects to
  the intent layer (Spec Kit) and technical layer (code) in a sustainable way
